 CSS BOX MODEL:

The CSS box model is essentially a box that wraps around every HTML element. It consists of: margins, borders, padding, and the actual content. The image below illustrates the box model:

Explanation of the different parts:

~Content - The content of the box, where text and images appear
~Padding - Clears an area around the content. The padding is transparent. By default its 6 on left and right and 1 at top and bottom of the button. 
~Border - A border that goes around the padding and content.
~Margin - Clears an area outside the border. The margin is transparent

The box model allows us to add a border around elements, and to define space between elements.
