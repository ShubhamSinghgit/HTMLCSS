What is a div element?
div stands for division . easy way to understand it is its just a box.
div is a block element so it takes up the entire line.
why div is useful??
--> It can contain any other element inside a div like para , images and also divs inside divs.
divs are meant to be containers 
we use containers everywhere
How block element in div works??
--> generally they take up entire line but here they take the entire line in the containers(div)

note: div by default is a block element so it takesthe entire line beside the container (preview) so to add something beside the div we first change the div to inline block.
