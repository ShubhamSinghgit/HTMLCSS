                     The selector that's more specific is going to have a higher priority
                    p is a selector targetting all paragraphs.
                     .videostats is another selector that targets a particular class

<!-- 
    What does specific means in selectors.
    Here in this code p {} targets all paragraphs while .vidstats{} targets just the paragraph with class name vidstats 
    Hence vidstats is more specific and has more priority.
    For now just know a class name has more priority than an element name.
